# hue-multicorn-postgresql-fdw
Multicorn based PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper for Phillips Hue Lighting Systems

We've implemented 3 of the Philips Hue Endpoints to date:
   Lights
   Sensors
   Config

If you come up with an implementation for Scenes and Groups endpoints - send a pull request!

After setting up your Hue system as per the Getting Started page, you add the multicorn extension to your database server, and then run the DDL in the setup_ddl folder to access your Philips Hue from your database.

A detailed readme is coming here soon - I promise!

Meanwhile, you can drop into the extras folder and read the PPT from the PGCONF US 2015 presentation to find an intro to this project.
